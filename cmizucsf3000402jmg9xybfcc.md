Skills are typically seen as isolated tools—you learn to swim, you can swim. You learn to drive, you can drive. The skill serves its purpose, and that's it.

But some skills don't just do their job. They unlock entirely new territories. They're not endpoints; they're enablers. I call them gateway skills.

Gateway skills are peculiar. They function as skills on their own, but they also influence other skills. They build bridges to paths you couldn't access otherwise. Reading, writing, drawing—these are the most striking examples.

However, a potential gateway skill only becomes an enabler through dense, sustained use. Knowing how to read isn't enough. You need to practice it a lot. Being a power user of a gateway skill isn't about amplifying the skill itself—it's about opening opportunities that remain locked without it. Side effects and byproducts start appearing. New doors reveal themselves.

## Reading: The Knowledge Opportunity

Reading is the most powerful gateway skill. Not because reading itself is magical, but because of what it enables.

First, reading lets you learn almost anything without formal schooling. A programmer who reads voraciously—documentation, blogs, books—can outpace someone with a CS degree who doesn't. Reading unlocks access to expertise that would otherwise require expensive courses or mentors. It's the cheapest and most accessible path to knowledge.

Second, reading builds intuitions and cross-pollinates ideas. The more you read, the more mental models you accumulate. You develop pattern recognition, taste, judgment—things that can't be taught directly but emerge from exposure. Darwin read geology, economics (Malthus), and biology—and that [cross-disciplinary reading led to evolution theory](https://friendsofdarwin.com/articles/darwin-reads-malthus/). Reading across domains lets you import concepts and see connections others miss. Innovation often comes from combining ideas from unrelated fields, and reading is the primary vehicle for that.

But here's the thing: none of this works unless you enter the loop.

I'm a strong proponent of starting with anything that brings you enjoyment. Crime novels, Harry Potter, whatever hooks you. The genre doesn't matter at the beginning—what matters is building the habit, finding pleasure in the act itself. I started with crime fiction and fantasy. Then classical novels. Now I read mostly non-fiction. But the progression only happened because I first entered the loop.

The Polish author Szczepan Twardoch once argued that the positive effects of reading are exaggerated. That we can find equally good sources of cultural development elsewhere. Watching a good TV show beats reading a poor book. In some ways, he's right. But this misses the point. When you treat reading as an enabler—a tool that pulls you toward more knowledge—the comparison falls apart. We need reading, and we need enjoyment in reading, to reach something bigger than reading itself. Reading becomes a vehicle, not a destination.

## Writing and Drawing: Gateways to Understanding

Writing and drawing are often seen as communication tools—ways to express what you already know. But their deeper power lies elsewhere. They're tools for thinking itself.

### Writing as Thinking

Writing isn't primarily about putting thoughts on paper. It's about discovering what your thoughts actually are. The process exposes gaps in your thinking like nothing else. Until you write your ideas down, you're usually convinced they're consistent and logical. But when you start writing, you see how many things are unclear, how many concepts need refining, how many holes need filling.

As Paul Graham put it in ["Putting Ideas into Words"](https://paulgraham.com/words.html): writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows you that you didn't know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas into words is a severe test.

This is why writing clarifies. It forces you to confront the mess in your head and turn mental clutter into clarity. Journaling can process emotional turmoil. Technical writing can untangle complex problems. The cognitive work happens in the act of articulating.

### Drawing as Understanding

Drawing works similarly, but through the hand and eye. It's a tool for understanding, visualizing, and explaining complex things.

Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience, loved art from the very beginning. He had no early inclination toward science. But his drawing ability provided scaffolding for everything that came later. When he learned anatomy, he drew bones. When he analyzed histological material, he visualized it through sketches. Drawing was a tool that gave him a helpful hand whenever he got stuck.

Cajal's ability to draw opened doors. It was a perfect match of supply and need—he was immersed in microscopy, anatomy, and histology, and drawing became his trampoline to understand complex biological structures. The skill that seemed basic became the enabler of his scientific breakthroughs. He believed in a simple motto: "drawing develops understanding."

Both writing and drawing share this quality: they seem like output skills, but they function as input skills. They don't just express understanding—they create it.

## Conclusion

Gateway skills share a pattern: they seem basic, they require dense practice to become enablers, and they produce cascading effects that extend far beyond the skill itself.

The mistake is to see these skills as paths to obvious vocations—writer, critic, artist. That's narrow thinking. The real power of gateway skills is that they enable everything *else*. A scientist who writes thinks more clearly. An engineer who sketches understands systems better. A manager who reads widely makes better decisions. Gateway skills aren't about becoming a professional in that skill. They're about using the skill as a lever for whatever you actually do.
