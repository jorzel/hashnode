Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a design paradigm in which system components communicate and operate through the production, detection, and consumption of events. In EDA, an event represents a significant change in state or occurrence within the system, and components (event producers) generate these events to signal state changes or actions. Other components (event consumers) respond to these events, triggering further processing or actions. This architecture promotes loose coupling, scalability, and flexibility, as components interact asynchronously and independently, reacting to events as they occur.

While asynchronous event-driven architecture (EDA) offers numerous advantages, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. There are scenarios where using a REST API might be more appropriate or advantageous. Firstly, we need it when an immediate response is required. However, the command approach when we call a given API endpoint can also be beneficial in asynchronous cases.

I remember that a few years ago when I refactored a distributed system, I wanted to redesign the communication in that way to use events publish-subscribe pattern (pub-sub) everywhere. I had heard a lot that it promotes decoupling and autonomy of services. However, pub-sub is only a technical way of API implementation and should be secondary to logical relationships between bounded contexts.

In EDA event producer typically owns the contract between services. This ownership stems from the nature of events: they inform about significant state changes or occurrences within the producer's domain.

Assume that we have a service that publishes a lot of various types of events and has a lot of consumers. In addition, it changes a lot over time because it is a core domain that we heavily iterate on. We often modify fields in the existing events and add new events. What's the problem? Each event change must be updated on each consumer. It is not a huge worry (but it can cause issues) if the publisher and the consumers are owned by my team. On the other hand, there will be a great deal of effort, coordination, and communication load if the two sides of the contract are maintained by separate teams.

Please think about a table reservation use case. When a table is reserved we should send a notification to the person that booked it. We consider two options:

* `TableReserved` event that is published by `ReservationService` and consumed by `NotificationService`

* `NotificationService` REST API that provides an endpoint to send email/SMS/etc.

At this stage, both options (A and B) look straightforward. Please notice the important thing: in the events approach `ReservationService` is a contract producer, while in the REST API approach `ReservationService` is a contract consumer. It is a significant relationship difference that affects future development.

What happens when we get a new requirement from the business that canceling a reservation should also send a notification message to the customer? In the events approach we probably need to add a new event `TableReservationCancelled` to `ReservationService` and handle the event on `NotificationService` side. So, two services need to be changed. On the other side, the REST API approach only needs a change in `ReservationService`. Of course, it assumes that `NotificationService` API is quite generic and takes stable parameters like `title`, `text`, `email_address`, etc. Nevertheless, it is a crucial thing. The REST API approach could be advantageous if one side of the contract is **stable and generic**. Other examples of generic subdomains (I have written more about subdomains' types [here](https://jorzel.hashnode.dev/strategic-domain-driven-design-subdomains-identification)) could be search engines or reporting. Due to its stability, the generic bounded context ought to be the relationship's upstream side and provide a contract. If you want to get to know more about upstream/downstream relationships I strongly recommend the DDD Context map tool (e.g. [chapter 4](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/what-is-domain-driven/9781492057802/ch04.html) of *What Is Domain-Driven Design?* by Vladik Khononov).

To conclude, it is a really good idea before implementing a solution to ask the following questions:

* which component of the relationship is more stable and will not change a lot in the future?
    
* do we have a generic subdomain?
    
* do we have a circular dependency (both components impose a part of the contract)? Sometimes it happens when both components publish events that are consumed by each other. It is usually a design smell.
    
* does component `A` should know anything about component `B`? In our example, is it necessary for `NotificationService` to know anything about the concept of the table reservation?
    

Event-driven architecture is a really good pattern for designing microservices but sometimes we need to be flexible and mix it with other approaches.
