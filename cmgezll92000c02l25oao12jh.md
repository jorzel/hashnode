I'm not sure why this is the case, but people often fall into a false binary when facing complex problems. Somehow, we convince ourselves that being a demanding parent automatically means we cannot be supportive and connected. That pursuing enjoyment in life must eradicate any struggle. We must choose one extreme or the other. However, this black-and-white thinking is really harmful to our personal development.

Aristotle captured this perfectly in his concept of the Golden Mean: "Virtue is the golden mean between two vices, the one of excess and the other of deficiency." The idea is simple yet profound: excellence is found in a moderate, balanced path between extremes. But here's the thing: being between extremes doesn't mean sitting passively in the middle. It means taking something from both sides and finding the necessary balance. And that balance is almost always contextual. You cannot decide it in advance.

I want to discuss a few areas in this post where we should aim for balance rather than mutual exclusion. Instead of picking one side and going all the way in that direction, the goal is to find the right mix.

## No Gratification vs. Immediate Gratification

You probably know about the [marshmallow experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment). It tells us that kids who can delay gratification are usually more successful in life. And this is probably true. This ability allows us to not over-optimize locally, to see beyond the immediate moment.

But if we focus too much on delaying gratification, we can end up in a situation where we have no gratification at all. We keep delaying it forever, and it makes us frustrated. The reward never comes because we're always waiting for the next milestone, the next achievement, the next "right time."

We need to be able to defer our rewards when it matters. But we also need the ability to take pleasure and enjoy the ride. Life isn't just about the destination. If you never taste the sweetness along the way, what's the point of the journey?

## Demand vs. Support

Sometimes we see this duality in parenting: on one side, you're a harsh parent with demands, rules, and high standards. On the other side, you're permissive—trying to find a connection on the same level, being almost a friend and mate. No constraints, just letting kids evolve in whatever direction they choose.

[In my article about wise leadership](https://medium.com/illuminations-mirror/demand-and-support-the-universal-patterns-of-leadership-9dacf6da3bfb), I underscored that maybe a third way is possible. You can be demanding, but also support your kids in fulfilling these demands. You give children necessary emotional validation while also maintaining reality alignment.

This is about providing both orientation in the world and connection. You show them the path, but you also make sure your child doesn't feel alone on their road. The demands give structure and direction. The support gives courage and resilience. Together, they create an environment where growth can actually happen.

## Deep Work vs. Shallow Work

Several years ago, [I wrote an article that was a deep work manifesto](https://medium.com/gitconnected/deep-work-essentialism-in-asynchronous-culture-6ab41ac0e8d3). I still believe focus and deep work are critical for high performance. However, after writing that article, I changed jobs and experienced firsthand how difficult it can be when your entire team is working in deep mode—when no one is open to questions and clarifications.

Deep work is great when everyone knows what needs to be done and how to do it. But in chaos, you need more connection and support. And this comes from shallow work: Slack messages, meetings, shared lunch, quick check-ins. These moments create the connective tissue that holds a team together.

Deep work can bring you focus, but it can also bring isolation. Shallow work can provide connectedness, but it can also create distraction. You need to balance these modes to be a great team player. Sometimes you need to close the door and dive deep. Other times, you need to keep the door open and stay available.

## Struggle vs. Enjoyment

For several years, I actively tried to figure out what it means to be talented. It resulted in a bunch of books read and a few articles written. I still don't have a clear standpoint. But over the journey, I encountered two great approaches for improving skills: flow and deliberate practice. And I think both can be practiced—maybe not at the same time, but as part of a development strategy.

[Flow is about being totally immersed in your activity](https://medium.com/illumination/can-we-work-differently-3c6d52eb0025), operating at the edge of your comfort zone. It brings great enjoyment. You lose track of time. The activity itself becomes the reward.

Deliberate practice advocates usually underscore that practice doesn't necessarily need to be enjoyable all the time. As Scott Young points out in his article about [flow and mastery](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2017/03/29/flow-doesnt-lead-to-mastery/), the characteristics of flow can actually be inconsistent with the demands of deliberate practice. Sometimes we need to tackle challenges that are difficult. We need to drill the fundamentals, work on our weaknesses, and push beyond what feels natural. This mental strain, while not enjoyable in the moment, is what produces real improvement.

However, it would be really difficult to maintain your training over a long period of time if you never feel the flow on your road. It would be overwhelming. You'd burn out. So you need to be aware of the danger zone, the comfort zone, and the learning zone. You need to be flexible and let yourself feel the flow from time to time. And sometimes you need to drill hard to take a step forward.

This tension exists in learning strategies too. Should you broaden your interests or drill down and develop expertise in one field? Again, it's contextual. Sometimes you need to explore new domains. Sometimes you need to gather more skills and knowledge within a specific area. The key is knowing when to do which.

## Action vs. Reflection

There's also a balance between stepping back and stepping in. Sometimes you need to reflect—reading books, listening to music, watching movies, finding inspiration by meeting friends, and traveling. These activities feed your mind and soul. They give you perspective.

And sometimes you need to act and improve your knowledge by doing. You need to get your hands dirty, make mistakes, and learn from real feedback. All the reflection in the world won't teach you what one failed experiment will.

The best growth happens when you can move fluidly between these modes. Reflect to gain insight. Act to test that insight. Step back to process what you learned. Step in to apply it again, better this time.

## Conclusion

Life is not a series of binary choices. It's a constant navigation between extremes, a dance where you sometimes lean one way and sometimes the other. The art of living well is not about choosing sides—it's about finding the balance that works for your context, your moment, your goals.

This balance isn't static either. What worked last year might not work today. What works at the office might not work at home. The wisdom lies not in finding the perfect balance once and for all, but in developing the sensitivity to know when you've drifted too far toward one extreme.

So pay attention. When you feel isolated, add more connection. When you feel scattered, create more focus. When you're burned out from struggle, allow yourself some flow. When you're too comfortable, introduce some challenge.

The golden mean isn't a destination. It's a practice. And like any practice, it gets better the more you do it.
